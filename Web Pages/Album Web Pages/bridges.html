                I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street<br>

                Were you standing in the hallway<br>
                With a big cake, happy birthday<br>
                Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?<br>
                A universe away<br>
                And when I got into the accident<br>
                The sight that flashed before me was your face<br>
                But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name<br>

                It turned into something bigger<br>
                Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed<br>
                Your finger on my hairpin triggers<br>
                Soldier down on that icy ground<br>
                Looked up at me with honor and truth<br>
                Broken and blue, so I called off the troops<br>
                That was the night I nearly lost you<br>
                I really thought I'd lost you<br>

                I prefer hiding in plain sight<br>
                My fourth drink in my hand<br>
                These desperate prayers of a cursed man<br>
                Spilling out to you for free<br>
                But darling, darling, please<br>
                You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking<br>
                If you knew where I was walking<br>
                To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there<br>
                Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care<br>

                You were the one that I loved<br>
                Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough<br>

                Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief<br>
                In the good in the world, you once believed in me<br>
                And I felt you and I held you for a while<br>
                Bet I could still melt your world<br>
