         Someone on <a href="https://twitter.com/blessedswifty/status/1564367669964718080" target="_blank">Twitter</a> found this <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxKTTIOeQZBeRbctwTk8t3LbIN8e8DHNWN" target="_blank">easter egg</a> in Taylor Swift's <a href="https://youtu.be/-BjZmE2gtdo?t=115" target="_blank">Lover Music Video</a> and noticed that each section of the "Lover House" represents a different era.

            Now the Lover House has become synonymous with Taylor Swift's eras.

         What are Swifties?<br>
         Well<br>
         Swifties are the name for Taylor Swift fans.<br>
         If you are a Taylor Swift fan, you can be considered a Swiftie.<br>
         The Swifties will quite honestly do anything for Taylor Swift<br>
         And, I need to emphasise, <a class="no-underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYTHdRoln6A" target="_blank"><strong>don't mess with the swifties.</strong></a>
      </p>
      <p>I don't think I made it clear, the swifties are the reason that <a href="Web Pages/Song Web Pages/Red/30) All Too Well (10 Minute Version).html" target="_blank">All Too Well (10 Minute Version)</a> exists,<br>

      <img class="MissAmericana" src="Images/Miss Americana.png" alt="Miss Americana Documentary Netflix Poster">
      <p>Miss Americana is a documentary that follows Taylor Swift over the course of several years of her career.
         <br>Released on the 31<sup>st</sup> of January 2020, released less than 6 months after she released her album "<a href="Web Pages/Album Web Pages/ts7.html">Lover</a>".
         <br>It is named after track 7 on <a href="Web Pages/Album Web Pages/ts7.html">Lover</a>: Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince.
         <br>It has been described as an "<em>unvarnished and emotionally revealing look into Taylor Swift's life</em>", it's shows a time where she starts to harness the power of her voice.
         <br>Along with this documentary, Taylor Swift also released a political song called "<a href="Web Pages/Song Web Pages/Singles/Only The Young.html">Only The Young</a>" for this movie.
         <br>I truly do recommend it.
         <br>You can watch it on Netflix <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81028336?trackId=255824129&tctx=0%2C0%2CNAPA%40%40%7Cec870bc6-cc73-4763-9fb6-1cd6b1b7e3cf-3331413_titles%2F1%2F%2Fmiss%20americaan%2F0%2F0%2CNAPA%40%40%7Cec870bc6-cc73-4763-9fb6-1cd6b1b7e3cf-3331413_titles%2F1%2F%2Fmiss%20americaan%2F0%2F0%2Cunknown%2C%2Cec870bc6-cc73-4763-9fb6-1cd6b1b7e3cf-3331413%7C1%2CtitlesResults%2C%2CVideo%3A81028336" target="_blank">here</a>.

      lyrics: [
         `Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow`,
         `Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats`,
         `Everybody here wanted something more`,
         `Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before`,
         `And it said`,
         `Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you`,
         `Welcome to New York, welcome to New York`,
         `Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you`,
         `Welcome to New York, welcome to New York`,
         `It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore`,
         `The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me`,
         `Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you`,
         `Welcome to New York, welcome to New York`,
         `When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors`,
         `Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer`,
         `Everybody here was someone else before`,
         `And you can want who you want`,
         `Boys and boys and girls and girls`,
         `Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you`,
         `Welcome to New York, welcome to New York`,
         `Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you`,

         `Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waiting for you`,
         `Welcome to New York, welcome to New York`,
         `Like any great love, it keeps you guessing`,
         `Like any real love, it's ever-changing`,
         `Like any true love, it drives you crazy`,
         `But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything`,
