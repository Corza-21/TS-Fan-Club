            Now the Lover House has become synonymous with Taylor Swift's eras.

         Well<br>
         Swifties are the name for Taylor Swift fans.<br>
         If you are a Taylor Swift fan, you can be considered a Swiftie.<br>
         The Swifties will quite honestly do anything for Taylor Swift<br>
         And, I need to emphasise, <a class="no-underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYTHdRoln6A" target="_blank"><strong>don't mess with the swifties.</strong></a>

      <h2>What is "Taylor's Version"</h2>
      <small>Written By AI</small>
      <p>
         Taylor Swift is re-recording her first six albums in order to regain control of her music after the rights to her original recordings were sold without her permission. She co-wrote every single song she's ever released, yet she does not own the songs on her first six records, which means that she has no say in how and where the music is used.<br><br>

         After more failed attempts to buy back the masters from Scooter Braun and Shamrock Holdings, Swift decided to begin re-recording her first six albums - releasing them under their original names and the parenthesis “Taylor's version”.<br><br>
         
         Taylor's decision to re-record her albums comes down to the simple fact that she wants to own the rights to the music that she wrote and recorded 1. She hopes that by re-recording her songs, she can override those archival works with these new versions.

         <br>It is named after track 7 on <a href="Web Pages/Album Web Pages/ts7.html">Lover</a>: Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince.
         <br>It has been described as an "<em>unvarnished and emotionally revealing look into Taylor Swift's life</em>", it's shows a time where she starts to harness the power of her voice.

      `But when you think Tim McGraw`,
      `I hope you think my favorite song`,
      `The one we danced to all night long`,
      `The moon like a spotlight on the lake`,
      `When you think happiness`,

      `When you think Tim McGraw`,
      `I hope you think of me`,
      `September saw a month of tears`,
      `And thankin' God that you weren't here`,

      `But in a box beneath my bed`,

      `So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time`,
      `As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn`,

      `The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star`,
      `He's the song in the car I keep singing`,

      `So I drive home alone`,
      `As I turn off the light`,
      `I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight`,
      `'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar`,

      `And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve`,

      `And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through`,
      `I've never been anywhere cold as you`,
      `You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray`,
      `And I stood there loving you and wished them all away`,
      `And you come away with a great little story`,
      `Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you`,
      `Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day`,
      `So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say`,
      `And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through`,
      `I've never been anywhere cold as you`,
      `You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you`,
      `And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you`,
      `(Died for you)`,

      // Mary's Song
      `She said I was seven and you were nine`,
      `I looked at you like the stars that shined`,
      `In the sky, the pretty lights`,
      `And our daddies used to joke about the two of us`,
      `Growing up and falling in love`,
      `And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes`,
      `And said, "Oh, my, my, my"`,
      `Take me back to the house in the backyard tree`,
      `Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me`,
      `You never did, you never did`,
      `Take me back when our world was one block wide`,
      `I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried`,
      `Just two kids, you and I`,
      `Oh, my, my, my, my`,
      `Well, I was sixteen when suddenly`,
      `I wasn't that little girl you used to see`,
      `But your eyes still shined like pretty lights`,
      `And our daddies used to joke about the two of us`,
      `They never believed we'd really fall in love`,
      `And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes`,
      `And said, "Oh, my, my, my"`,
      `Take me back to the creek beds we turned up`,
      `2 a.m. riding in your truck`,
      `And all I need is you next to me`,
      `Take me back to the time we had our very first fight`,
      `The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight`,
      `You stayed outside 'til the morning light`,
      `Oh, my, my, my, my`,
      `A few years had gone and come around`,
      `We were sitting at our favorite spot in town`,
      `And you looked at me, got down on one knee`,
      `Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle`,
      `Our whole town came and our mamas cried`,
      `You said, "I do," and I did, too`,
      `Take me home where we met so many years before`,
      `We'll rock our babies on that very front porch`,
      `After all this time, you and I`,
      `And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine`,
      `I'll still look at you like the stars that shine`,
      `In the sky, oh, my, my, my`,
      // Our Song
      `I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone`,
      `In the front seat of his car`,
      `He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel`,
      `The other on my heart`,
      `I look around, turn the radio down`,
      `He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"`,
      `I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin'`,
      `How we don't have a song"`,
      `And he says`,
      `Our song is the slamming screen door`,
      `Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window`,
      `When we're on the phone and you talk real slow`,
      `'Cause it's late and your mama don't know`,
      `Our song is the way you laugh`,
      `The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"`,
      `And when I got home, 'fore I said amen`,
      `Askin' God if he could play it again`,
      `I was walking up the front porch steps`,
      `After everything that day`,
      `Had gone all wrong or been trampled on`,
      `And lost and thrown away`,
      `Got to the hallway, well on my way`,
      `To my lovin' bed`,
      `I almost didn't notice all the roses`,
      `And the note that said`,
      `Our song is the slamming screen door`,
      `Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window`,
      `When we're on the phone and you talk real slow`,
      `'Cause it's late and your mama don't know`,
      `Our song is the way you laugh`,
      `The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"`,
      `And when I got home, 'fore I said amen`,
      `Askin' God if he could play it again`,
      `Da-da-da-da`,
      `I've heard every album, listened to the radio`,
      `Waited for somethin' to come along`,
      `That was as good as our song`,
      `'Cause our song is the slamming screen door`,
      `Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window`,
      `When we're on the phone and he talks real slow`,
      `'Cause it's late and his mama don't know`,
      `Our song is the way he laughs`,
      `The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"`,
      `And when I got home, 'fore I said amen`,
      `Askin' God if he could play it again`,
      `Play it again, oh, yeah`,
      `Oh, oh, yeah`,
      `I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone`,
      `In the front seat of his car`,
      `I grabbed a pen and an old napkin`,
      `And I wrote down our song`,

      `'Cause one second it was perfect`,
      `Now you're halfway out the door`,

      `And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"`,
      `Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong`,
      `It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone`,
      `'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"`,
      `Was I out of line?`,
      `Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide`,
      `Like a scared little boy?`,
      `I looked into your eyes`,

      `Here's to silence that cuts me to the core`,
      `Where is this going?`,
      `Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore`,

      `Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong`,
      `It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone`,
      `'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"`,
      `You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so`,
      `Oh, back up, baby, back up`,
      `Did you forget everything?`,
      `Back up, baby, back up`,
      `Did you forget everything?`,
      `'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong`,

      `I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school`,
      `But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you`,
      `Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay`,

      `Had the best days with you`,
      `There is a video I found from back when I was three`,
      `You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me`,
      `It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves`,
      `Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world`,
      `Now I know why all the trees change in the fall`,
      `I know you were on my side even when I was wrong`,
      `And I love you for giving me your eyes`,
      `For staying back and watching me shine`,

      `Fight for what we've worked for all these years`,
      `And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives`,
      `But we'll stand up champions tonight`,
      `It was the night things changed`,
      `Can you see it now?`,
      `When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down`,
      `It's a revolution, throw your hands up`,
      `'Cause we never gave in`,

      `It wasn't just like a movie`,
      `The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin`,
      `I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say`,
      `This is the last time I'll drive this way again`,
      `Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray`,

      `Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side`,
      `Bye bye, baby`,
      `I want you bad but it's come down to nothing`,
      `And all I have is your sympathy`,
      `'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me`,
      `Bye bye, baby`,
      `Bye bye, baby`,
      `The picture frame is empty`,
      `On the dresser, vacant just like me`,
      `I see your writing on the dash`,
      `Then back to your hesitation`,
      `I was so sure of everything`,
      `Everything I thought we'd always have`,
      `Guess I never doubted it`,
      `Then the here and the now floods in`,

      `Bye bye, baby`,
      `I want you bad but it's come down to nothing`,
      `And all I have is your sympathy`,
      `'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me`,
      `Bye bye, baby`,
      `And there's so much that I can't touch`,
      `You're all I want but it's not enough this time`,
      `And all the pages are just slipping through my hands`,
      `And I'm so scared of how this ends`,
      `Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side`,
      `Bye bye, baby`,
      `I want you bad but it's come down to nothing`,
      `And all I have is your sympathy`,

      // If This Was A Movie
      `Last night, I heard my own heart beatin'`,
      `Sounded like footsteps on my stairs`,
      `Six months gone and I'm still reachin'`,
      `Even though I know you're not there`,
      `I was playin' back a thousand memories, baby`,

      `But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now`,
      `I know people change and these things happen`,
      `But I remember how it was back then`,
      `Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'`,
      `'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them`,
      `Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street`,
      `Flashback to the night when you said to me`,
      `Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you`,
      `Back before I knew how much I had to lose`,
      `Come back, come back, come back to me like`,
      `You would, you would if this was a movie`,

      `I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone`,
      `I just want it back the way it was before`,
      `And I just wanna see you back at my front door`,

      `You would before you said it's not that easy`,
      `Before the fight, before I locked you out"`,

      `Oh-oh, oh-oh`,
      `You were in college working part time waitin' tables`,
      `Left a small town, never looked back`,
      `I was a flight risk with a fear of falling`,
      `Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts`,
      `I say, "Can you believe it?"`,
      `As we're lyin' on the couch`,
      `The moment I could see it`,
      `Yes, yes, I can see it now`,
      `Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?`,
      `You put your arm around me for the first time`,
      `You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter`,
      `You are the best thing that's ever been mine`,
      `Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together`,
      `And there's a drawer of my things at your place`,
      `You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded`,
      `You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes`,
      `But we got bills to pay`,
      `We got nothing figured out`,
      `When it was hard to take`,
      `Yes, yes, this is what I thought about`,
      `Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?`,
      `You put your arm around me for the first time`,
      `You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter`,
      `You are the best thing that's ever been mine`,
      `Do you remember all the city lights on the water?`,
      `You saw me start to believe for the first time`,
      `You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter`,
      `You are the best thing that's ever been mine`,
      `Oh-oh, oh-oh`,
      `And I remember that fight, 2:30AM`,
      `As everything was slipping right out of our hands`,
      `I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street`,
      `Braced myself for the goodbye`,
      `'Cause that's all I've ever known`,
      `Then you took me by surprise`,
      `You said, "I'll never leave you alone"`,
      `You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water`,
      `And every time I look at you, it's like the first time`,
      `I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter`,
      `She is the best thing that's ever been mine"`,
      `Hold on, make it last`,

      `You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'`,
      `But I kinda know that I won't get far`,
      `And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch`,
      `Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of`,
      `Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain`,
      `Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain`,
      `'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile`,
      `Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down`,

      `'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile`,
      `My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea`,
      `You touch me once and it's really somethin'`,
      `You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be`,
      `I'm on my guard for the rest of the world`,

      `And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?`,
      `I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show`,
      `Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain`,
      `Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain`,

      `You've been good, busier than ever`,
      `We small talk, work and the weather`,
      `Your guard is up and I know why`,
      `Because the last time you saw me`,
      `Is still burned in the back of your mind`,
      `You gave me roses and I left them there to die`,
      `So, this is me swallowing my pride`,
      `Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night"`,
      `And I go back to December all the time`,
      `It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you`,

      `I go back to December all the time`,
      `These days, I haven't been sleeping`,
      `Staying up, playing back myself leaving`,
      `When your birthday passed and I didn't call`,
      `And I think about summer, all the beautiful times`,
      `I watched you laughing from the passenger side`,
      `And realized I loved you in the fall`,
      `And then the cold came, the dark days`,
      `When fear crept into my mind`,
      `You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye`,
      `So, this is me swallowing my pride`,
      `Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night"`,
      `And I go back to December all the time`,
      `It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you`,
      `Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine`,
      `I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind`,
      `I go back to December all the time`,
      `I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile`,
      `So good to me, so right`,
      `And how you held me in your arms that September night`,
      `The first time you ever saw me cry`,
      `Maybe this is wishful thinking`,
      `Probably mindless dreaming`,
      `But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right`,
      `I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't`,
      `So, if the chain is on your door, I understand`,
      `But this is me swallowing my pride`,
      `Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night"`,

      `And I'm dying to know`,
      `Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah`,
      `I don't know what to say since the twist of fate`,
      `When it all broke down`,
      `And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now`,
      `This is looking like a contest`,
      `Of who can act like they care less`,
      `But I liked it better when you were on my side`,
      `The battle's in your hands now`,
      `But I would lay my armor down`,
      `If you said you'd rather love than fight`,
      `So many things that you wish I knew`,
      `But the story of us might be ending soon`,
      `Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room`,
      `And we're not speaking`,
      `And I'm dying to know`,
      `Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah`,
      `I don't know what to say since the twist of fate`,
      `When it all broke down`,
      `The story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now`,
      `And we're not speaking`,
      `And I'm dying to know`,
      `Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah`,
      `I don't know what to say since the twist of fate`,
      `'Cause we're goin' down`,
      `And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now`,
      `The end`,
      // Never Grow Up
      `Your little hand's wrapped around my finger`,
      `And it's so quiet in the world tonight`,
      `Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming`,
      `So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight`,
      `To you, everything's funny`,
      `You got nothing to regret`,
      `I'd give all I have, honey`,
      `If you could stay like that`,
      `Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up`,
      `Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little`,
      `Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up`,
      `Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple`,
      `I won't let nobody hurt you`,
      `Won't let no one break your heart`,
      `And no one will desert you`,
      `Just try to never grow up`,
      `Never grow up`,
      `You're in the car on the way to the movies`,
      `And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off`,
      `At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do`,
      `And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots`,
      `But don't make her drop you off around the block`,
      `Remember that she's getting older, too`,
      `And don't lose the way that you dance around`,
      `In your PJs getting ready for school`,
      `Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up`,
      `Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little`,
      `Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up`,
      `Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple`,
      `No one's ever burned you`,
      `Nothing's ever left you scarred`,
      `And even though you want to`,
      `Just try to never grow up`,
      `Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room`,
      `Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home`,
      `Remember the footsteps, remember the words said`,
      `And all your little brother's favorite songs`,
      `I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone`,
      `So here I am in my new apartment`,
      `In a big city, they just dropped me off`,
      `It's so much colder than I thought it would be`,
      `So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on`,
      `Wish I'd never grown up`,
      `I wish I'd never grown up`,
      `Oh, I don't wanna grow up`,
      `Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little`,
      `Oh, I don't wanna grow up`,
      `Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple`,
      `Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up`,
      `Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little`,
      `Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up`,
      `Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple`,
      `Won't let nobody hurt you`,
      `Won't let no one break your heart`,
      `And even though you want to`,
      `Please try to never grow up`,
      `Oh, oh`,
      `Don't you ever grow up`,
      `Oh (Never grow up), just never grow up`,
      // Enchanted
      `There I was again tonight`,
      `Forcing laughter, faking smiles`,
      `Same old tired, lonely place`,
      `Walls of insincerity`,
      `Shifting eyes and vacancy`,
      `Vanished when I saw your face`,
      `All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you`,
      `Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"`,
      `Across the room, your silhouette`,
      `Starts to make its way to me`,
      `The playful conversation starts`,
      `Counter all your quick remarks`,
      `Like passing notes in secrecy`,
      `And it was enchanting to meet you`,
      `All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you`,
      `This night is sparkling, don't you let it go`,
      `I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home`,
      `I'll spend forever wondering if you knew`,
      `I was enchanted to meet you`,
      `The lingering question kept me up`,
      `2AM, who do you love?`,
      `I wonder 'til I'm wide awake`,
      `Now I'm pacing back and forth`,
      `Wishing you were at my door`,
      `I'd open up and you would say`,
      `"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"`,
      `All I know is I was enchanted to meet you`,
      `This night is sparkling, don't you let it go`,
      `I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home`,
      `I'll spend forever wondering if you knew`,
      `This night is flawless, don't you let it go`,
      `I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone`,
      `I'll spend forever wondering if you knew`,
      `I was enchanted to meet you`,
      `This is me praying that`,
      `This was the very first page`,
      `Not where the storyline ends`,
      `My thoughts will echo your name`,
      `Until I see you again`,
      `These are the words I held back`,
      `As I was leaving too soon`,
      `I was enchanted to meet you`,
      `Please don't be in love with someone else`,
      `Please don't have somebody waiting on you`,
      `Please don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)`,
      `Please don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)`,
      `This night is sparkling, don't you let it go`,
      `I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home`,
      `I'll spend forever wondering if you knew`,
      `This night is flawless (Please don't be in love with someone else)`,
      `Don't you let it go`,
      `I'm wonderstruck (Please don't have somebody waiting on you)`,
      `Dancing around all alone`,
      `I'll spend forever (Please don't be in love with someone else)`,

      `Please don't have somebody waiting on you`,
      // Better Than Revenge
      `Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did`,
      `Ha, time for a little revenge`,
      `The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and`,
      `I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him`,
      `She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause`,
      `She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"`,
      `I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it`,
      `I underestimated just who I was dealing with`,
      `She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum`,
      `She underestimated just who she was stealing from`,
      `She's not a saint and she's not what you think`,
      `She's an actress, woah`,
      `She's better known for the things that she does`,
      `On the mattress, woah`,
      `Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys`,
      `On the playground won't make you many friends`,
      `She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind`,
      `There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha`,
      `She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list`,
      `She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it`,
      `I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and`,
      `She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things`,
      `But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know`,
      `Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go`,
      `Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me`,
      `But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity`,
      `(Think about what you did)`,
      `She's not a saint and she's not what you think`,
      `She's an actress, woah`,
      `She's better known for the things that she does`,
      `On the mattress, woah`,
      `Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys`,
      `On the playground won't make you many friends`,
      `She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind`,
      `There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha`,
      `I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey`,
      `You might have him, but haven't you heard?`,
      `I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey`,
      `You might have him, but I always get the last word`,
      `Woah, woah-ah-oh`,
      `She's not a saint and she's not what you think`,
      `She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)`,
      `She's better known for the things that she does`,
      `On the mattress, woah`,
      `Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys`,
      `On the playground won't make you many friends`,
      `She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind`,
      `There is nothing I do better than revenge`,
      `Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?`,
      `'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)`,
      `Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)`,
      `I don't think you do, I don't think you do`,
      `Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)`,
      `Come on, show me how much better you are`,
      `(So much better, yeah?)`,
      `See, you deserve some applause`,
      `'Cause you're so much better`,
      `She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"`,
      // Innocent
      `I guess you really did it this time`,
      `Left yourself in your war path`,
      `Lost your balance on a tightrope`,
      `Lost your mind trying to get it back`,
      `Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?`,
      `Always a bigger bed to crawl into`,
      `Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything`,
      `And everybody believed in you?`,
      `It's alright, just wait and see`,
      `Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh`,
      `Who you are is not where you've been`,
      `You're still an innocent`,
      `You're still an innocent`,
      `Did some things you can't speak of`,
      `But at night, you live it all again`,
      `You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now`,
      `If only you had seen what you know now then`,
      `Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?`,
      `When everything out of reach`,
      `Someone bigger brought down to you`,
      `Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep`,
      `Before the monsters caught up to you?`,
      `It's alright, just wait and see`,
      `Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh`,
      `Who you are is not where you've been`,
      `You're still an innocent`,
      `It's okay, and life is a tough crowd`,
      `Thirty-two and still growing up now`,
      `Who you are is not what you did`,
      `You're still an innocent`,
      `Time turns flames to embers`,
      `You'll have new Septembers`,
      `Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh`,
      `Minds change like the weather`,
      `I hope you remember`,
      `Today is never too late to be brand new, oh`,
      `It's alright, just wait and see`,
      `Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh`,
      `Who you are is not where you've been`,
      `You're still an innocent`,
      `It's okay, and life is a tough crowd`,
      `Thirty-two and still growing up now`,
      `Who you are is not what you did`,
      `You're still an innocent`,
      `You're still an innocent`,
      `Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh`,
      `It's never too late to get it back`,
      // Haunted
      `You and I walk a fragile line`,
      `I have known it all this time`,
      `But I never thought I'd live to see it break`,
      `It's getting dark and it's all too quiet`,
      `And I can't trust anything now`,
      `And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake`,
      `Woah, holding my breath`,
      `Won't lose you again`,
      `Something's made your eyes go cold`,
      `Come on, come on, don't leave me like this`,
      `I thought I had you figured out`,
      `Something's gone terribly wrong`,
      `You're all I wanted`,
      `Come on, come on, don't leave me like this`,
      `I thought I had you figured out`,
      `Can't breathe whenever you're gone`,
      `Can't turn back now, I'm haunted`,
      `Stood there and watched you walk away`,
      `From everything we had`,
      `But I still mean every word I said to you`,
      `He will try to take away my pain`,
      `And he just might make me smile`,
      `But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead`,
      `Oh, holding my breath`,
      `Won't see you again`,
      `Something keeps me holding onto nothing`,
      `Come on, come on, don't leave me like this`,
      `I thought I had you figured out`,
      `Something's gone terribly wrong`,
      `You're all I wanted`,

      `I have known it all this time`,
      `Never ever thought I'd see it break`,
      `Never thought I'd see it`,
      // Last Kiss
      `I still remember the look on your face`,
      `Lit through the darkness at 1:58`,
      `The words that you whispered for just us to know`,
      `You told me you loved me`,
      `So why did you go away?`,
      `Away`,
      `I do recall now, the smell of the rain`,
      `Fresh on the pavement`,
      `I ran off the plane`,
      `That July ninth, the beat of your heart`,
      `It jumps through your shirt`,
      `I can still feel your arms`,
      `But now I'll go`,
      `Sit on the floor wearing your clothes`,
      `All that I know is I don't know`,
      `How to be something you miss`,
      `I never thought we'd have a last kiss`,
      `Never imagined we'd end like this`,
      `Your name, forever the name on my lips`,
      `I do remember the swing of your step`,
      `The life of the party, you're showing off again`,
      `And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in`,
      `I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did`,
      `Because I love your handshake, meeting my father`,
      `I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets`,
      `How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something`,
      `There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions`,
      `And I'll go`,
      `Sit on the floor wearing your clothes`,
      `All that I know is I don't know`,
      `How to be something you miss`,
      `I never thought we'd have a last kiss`,
      `I never imagined we'd end like this`,
      `Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh`,
      `So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep`,
      `And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe`,
      `And I'll keep up with our old friends`,
      `Just to ask them how you are`,
      `Hope it's nice where you are`,
      `And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day`,
      `And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed`,
      `You can plan for a change in the weather and time`,
      `But I never planned on you changing your mind`,
      `So, I'll go`,
      `Sit on the floor wearing your clothes`,
      `All that I know is I don't know`,
      `How to be something you miss`,
      `I never thought we'd have a last kiss`,
      `Never imagined we'd end like this`,
      `Your name, forever the name on my lips`,
      `Just like our last kiss`,
      `Forever the name on my lips`,
      `Forever the name on my lips`,
      `Just like our last`,
      // Long Live
      `I said, "Remember this moment"`,
      `In the back of my mind`,
      `The time we stood with our shaking hands`,
      `The crowds in stands went wild`,
      `We were the kings and the queens`,
      `And they read off our names`,
      `The night you danced like you knew our lives would`,
      `Never be the same`,
      `You held your head like a hero on a history book page`,
      `It was the end of a decade`,
      `But the start of an age`,
      `Long live the walls we crashed through`,
      `How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you`,
      `I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"`,
      `And bring on all the pretenders`,
      `One day, we will be remembered`,
      `I said, "Remember this feeling"`,
      `I pass the pictures around`,
      `Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines`,
      `Wishing for right now`,
      `We are the kings and the queens`,
      `You traded your baseball cap for a crown`,
      `When they gave us our trophies`,
      `And we held them up for our town`,
      `And the cynics were outraged`,
      `Screaming, "This is absurd"`,
      `'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans`,
      `Got to rule the world`,
      `Long live the walls we crashed through`,
      `How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you`,
      `I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"`,
      `And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid`,
      `Long live all the mountains we moved`,
      `I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you`,
      `I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"`,
      `And bring on all the pretenders`,
      `One day, we will be remembered`,
      `Hold on to spinning around`,
      `Confetti falls to the ground`,
      `May these memories break our fall`,
      `Will you take a moment? Promise me this`,
      `That you'll stand by me forever`,
      `But if, God forbid, fate should step in`,
      `And force us into a goodbye`,
      `If you have children some day`,
      `When they point to the pictures`,
      `Please tell 'em my name`,
      `Tell 'em how the crowds went wild`,
      `Tell 'em how I hope they shine`,
      `Long live the walls we crashed through`,
      `I had the time of my life with you`,
      `Long, long live the walls we crashed through`,
      `How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you`,
      `And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"`,
      `And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid`,
      `Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"`,
      `I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you`,
      `And long, long live that look on your face`,
      `And bring on all the pretenders`,
      `One day, we will be remembered`,
      // Ours
      `Elevator buttons and morning air`,
      `Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs`,
      `If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares`,
      `But right now, my time is theirs`,
      `Seems like there's always someone who disapproves`,
      `They'll judge it like they know about me and you`,
      `And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do`,
      `The jury's out, but my choice is you`,
      `So don't you worry your pretty little mind`,
      `People throw rocks at things that shine`,
      `And life makes love look hard`,
      `The stakes are high, the water's rough`,
      `But this love is ours`,
      `You never know what people have up their sleeves`,
      `Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me`,
      `Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles`,
      `But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine`,
      `And you'll say`,
      `Don't you worry your pretty little mind`,
      `People throw rocks at things that shine`,
      `And life makes love look hard`,
      `The stakes are high, the water's rough`,
      `But this love is ours`,
      `And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and`,
      `Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and`,
      `I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you`,
      `'Cause I love the gap between your teeth`,
      `And I love the riddles that you speak`,
      `And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos`,
      `Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours`,
      `So don't you worry your pretty little mind`,

      // Stay Stay Stay
      `I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night`,
      `I threw my phone across the room, at you`,
      `I was expecting some dramatic turn away`,
      `But you stayed`,
      `This morning, I said we should talk about it`,
      `'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved`,
      `That's when you came in wearing a football helmet`,
      `And said, "Okay, let's talk"`,
      `And I said`,
      `Stay, stay, stay`,
      `I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time`,
      `You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad`,
      `But I think that it's best if we both stay`,
      `Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers`,
      `Who took all of their problems out on me`,
      `But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing`,
      `And I love you because you have given me`,
      `No choice but to`,
      `Stay, stay, stay`,
      `I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time`,
      `You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad`,

      `You took the time to memorize me`,
      `My fears, my hopes, and dreams`,
      `I just like hanging out with you all the time`,
      `All those times that you didn't leave`,
      `It's been occurring to me`,
      `I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life`,
      `Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time`,
      `No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad`,
      `So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay`,
      `Stay, stay, stay, stay`,
      `Stay, stay, stay`,
      `I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time`,

      `I was reminiscing just the other day`,
      `While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away`,

      `Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme`,
      `Took off faster than a green light, go`,
      `Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know`,
      `I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made`,
      `And that was the first day`,
      `And darling, it was good`,
      `Never looking down`,
      `And right there where we stood`,
      `Was holy ground`,
      `Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress`,
      `We had this big, wide city all to ourselves`,
      `We block the noise with the sound of "I need you"`,
      `And for the first time, I had something to lose`,
      `And I guess we fell apart in the usual way`,
      `And the story's got dust on every page`,
      `But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now`,
      `And I see your face in every crowd`,
      `'Cause darling, it was good`,
      `Never looking down`,
      `And right there where we stood`,
      `Was holy ground`,
      `Tonight I'm gonna dance`,
      `For all that we've been through`,

      `You said it in a simple way`,
      `4 AM, the second day`,

      `One last kiss, then catch your flight`,

      `I guess you're in New York today`,
      `I don't wanna need you this way`,

      `The delicate beginning rush`,
      `The feeling you can know so much`,
      `Without knowing anything at all`,
      `And now that I can put this down`,
      `If I had known what I know now`,
      `I never would've played so nonchalant`,
      `Taxi cabs and busy streets`,
      `That never bring you back to me`,

      `This is falling for you when you are worlds away`,
      `In New York, be here`,
      `But you're in London, and I break down`,

      `I walked through the door with you, the air was cold`,

         `And I left my scarf there at your sister's house`,
         `And you've still got it in your drawer, even now`,
         `Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze`,
         `We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate`,
         `Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place`,
         `And I can picture it after all these days`,
         `And I know it's long gone and`,
         `That magic's not here no more`,
         `And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all`,
         `Oh, oh, oh`,
         `'Cause there we are again on that little town street`,
         `You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me`,
         `Wind in my hair, I was there`,
         `I remember it all too well`,
         `Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red`,
         `You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed`,
         `And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team`,
         `You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me`,
         `And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"`,
         `Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town`,
         `And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now`,
         `He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was`,
         `'Til we were dead and gone and buried`,
         `Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same`,
         `After three months in the grave`,
         `And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you`,
         `But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame`,
         `And I know it's long gone and`,
         `There was nothing else I could do`,
         `And I forget about you long enough`,
         `To forget why I needed to`,
         `'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night`,
         `We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light`,
         `Down the stairs, I was there`,
         `I remember it all too well`,
         `And there we are again when nobody had to know`,
         `You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath`,
         `Sacred prayer and we'd swear`,
         `To remember it all too well, yeah`,
         `Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much`,
         `But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up`,
         `Runnin' scared, I was there`,
         `I remember it all too well`,
         `And you call me up again just to break me like a promise`,
         `So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest`,
         `I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here`,
         `'Cause I remember it all, all, all`,
         `They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell`,
         `Every time you double-cross my mind`,
         `You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine`,
         `And that made me want to die`,
         `The idea you had of me, who was she?`,
         `A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you`,
         `Not weepin' in a party bathroom`,
         `Some actress askin' me what happened, you`,
         `That's what happened, you`,
         `You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes`,
         `Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show`,
         `But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come`,
         `And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"`,
         `Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it`,
         `I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it`,
         `After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own`,
         `Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone`,
         `But you keep my old scarf from that very first week`,
         `'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me`,
         `You can't get rid of it`,
         `'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah`,
         `'Cause there we are again when I loved you so`,
         `Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known`,
         `It was rare, I was there`,
         `I remember it all too well`,

         `And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes`,
         `"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"`,
         `From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones`,
         `I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight`,
         `And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?`,
         `Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?`,
         `'Cause in this city's barren cold`,
         `I still remember the first fall of snow`,

         `Just between us, do you remember it all too well?`,
