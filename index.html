         Someone on <a href="https://twitter.com/blessedswifty/status/1564367669964718080" target="_blank">Twitter</a> found this <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxKTTIOeQZBeRbctwTk8t3LbIN8e8DHNWN" target="_blank">easter egg</a> in Taylor Swift's <a href="https://youtu.be/-BjZmE2gtdo?t=115" target="_blank">Lover Music Video</a> and noticed that each section of the "Lover House" represents a different era.

            Now the Lover House has become synonymous with Taylor Swift's eras.

         What are Swifties?<br>
         Well<br>
         Swifties are the name for Taylor Swift fans.<br>
         If you are a Taylor Swift fan, you can be considered a Swiftie.<br>
         The Swifties will quite honestly do anything for Taylor Swift<br>
         And, I need to emphasise, <a class="no-underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYTHdRoln6A" target="_blank"><strong>don't mess with the swifties.</strong></a>
      </p>
      <p>I don't think I made it clear, the swifties are the reason that <a href="Web Pages/Song Web Pages/Red/30) All Too Well (10 Minute Version).html" target="_blank">All Too Well (10 Minute Version)</a> exists,<br>

      <img class="MissAmericana" src="Images/Miss Americana.png" alt="Miss Americana Documentary Netflix Poster">
      <p>Miss Americana is a documentary that follows Taylor Swift over the course of several years of her career.
         <br>Released on the 31<sup>st</sup> of January 2020, released less than 6 months after she released her album "<a href="Web Pages/Album Web Pages/ts7.html">Lover</a>".
         <br>It is named after track 7 on <a href="Web Pages/Album Web Pages/ts7.html">Lover</a>: Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince.
         <br>It has been described as an "<em>unvarnished and emotionally revealing look into Taylor Swift's life</em>", it's shows a time where she starts to harness the power of her voice.
         <br>Along with this documentary, Taylor Swift also released a political song called "<a href="Web Pages/Song Web Pages/Singles/Only The Young.html">Only The Young</a>" for this movie.
         <br>I truly do recommend it.
         <br>You can watch it on Netflix <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81028336?trackId=255824129&tctx=0%2C0%2CNAPA%40%40%7Cec870bc6-cc73-4763-9fb6-1cd6b1b7e3cf-3331413_titles%2F1%2F%2Fmiss%20americaan%2F0%2F0%2CNAPA%40%40%7Cec870bc6-cc73-4763-9fb6-1cd6b1b7e3cf-3331413_titles%2F1%2F%2Fmiss%20americaan%2F0%2F0%2Cunknown%2C%2Cec870bc6-cc73-4763-9fb6-1cd6b1b7e3cf-3331413%7C1%2CtitlesResults%2C%2CVideo%3A81028336" target="_blank">here</a>.
