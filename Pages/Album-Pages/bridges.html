                I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street<br>
                Braced myself for the goodbye<br>
                'Cause that's all I've ever known<br>
                Then you took me by surprise<br>
                You said, "I'll never leave you alone"<br>

                Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right<br>
                And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?<br>
                I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show<br>

                So good to me, so right<br>
                And how you held me in your arms that September night<br>
                The first time you ever saw me cry<br>
                Maybe this is wishful thinking<br>
                Probably mindless dreaming<br>
                But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right<br>

                Back when we were still changin' for the better<br>
                Wanting was enough<br>
                For me, it was enough<br>
                To live for the hope of it all<br>
                Cancel plans just in case you'd call<br>
                And say, "Meet me behind the mall"<br>
                So much for summer love and saying "us"<br>
                'Cause you weren't mine to lose<br>
                You weren't mine to lose, no<br>

                She said "James, get in, let's drive"<br>

                I prefer hiding in plain sight<br>
                My fourth drink in my hand<br>
                These desperate prayers of a cursed man<br>
                Spilling out to you for free<br>
                But darling, darling, please<br>
                You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking<br>
                If you knew where I was walking<br>
                To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there<br>
                Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care<br>
                No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire<br>

                I find the artifacts, cried over a hat<br>
                Cursed the space that I needed<br>
                I trace the evidence, make it make some sense<br>
                Why the wound is still bleedin'<br>
                You were the one that I loved<br>
                Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough<br>
                A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes<br>
                This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy<br>
                Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief<br>
                In the good in the world, you once believed in me<br>
                And I felt you and I held you for a while<br>
                Bet I could still melt your world<br>
                Argumentative, antithetical dream girl<br>
