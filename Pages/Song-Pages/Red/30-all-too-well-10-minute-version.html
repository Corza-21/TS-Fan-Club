            <!--ABOUT-->
            <h2>About <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i></h2>
            <p>From <a class="disguise" href="https://genius.com" target="_blank">Genius</a>, the ultimate source of music knowledge</p>
            <p>
                Track 30 on "<a href="/red">Red</a>".<br><br>
                Widely regarded as one of Swift's best songs, "All Too Well" sees her picking up shards of memories after a gut-wrenching breakup. She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex, making the listener feel as though they were there with the couple.<br><br>

                Swift told Pop Dust that she began writing the song in a soundcheck for her 2011 tour in support of Speak Now. Co-writer Liz Rose explained that the song was initially 10-15 minutes long before she helped Swift pare it down, and Swift shared some of the original lyrics in a deluxe edition of her 2019 album, Lover.<br><br>
                
                Melodically, this version of "All Too Well" is more subdued than the version we hear on the album. This change is evident throughout the song. This version begins with a saccharine melody before building up to a steady drum beat, while the original is heavily backed by guitar.<br><br>
                
                Lyrically, the songs are also different. This ten minute version is more vitriolic and bitter, while the album version is bittersweet. The metaphors in Verse 3 are reminiscent of folklore/evermore era Taylor, rather than Red era, with comparisons to bolder themes like death and tragedy rather than just the specific memories present in the original.<br><br>
                
                Many believe Swift took inspiration from her relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal â€” the secret message "Maple Lattes" is hidden in the song's liner notes, and the two shared those coffees in November 2010. In a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, Gyllenhaal claimed to not know that Swift wrote a song about him, though she seemingly told Vulture he reached out to her after hearing the album.<br><br>
                
                "All Too Well" was the fourth song to contribute to Swift's "Track Five pattern," a pattern fans have noted where she puts one of the most emotive songs on an album as the fifth track. Previous examples were "Cold As You," "White Horse," and "Dear John."<br><br>
                
                As a tribute to her fans and the massive impact this song had on her personal and professional life, Swift wrote and produced a short film for the song, starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien.<br><br>

                All Too Well (10 Minute Version) means a lot to me and I love her so much ðŸ’œ

                I walked through the door with you, the air was cold<br>
                But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow<br>
                And I left my scarf there at your sister's house<br>
                And you've still got it in your drawer, even now<br>

                Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze<br>
                We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate<br>
                Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place<br>
                And I can picture it after all these days<br>

                And I know it's long gone and<br>
                That magic's not here no more<br>
                And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all<br>
                Oh, oh, oh<br>

                'Cause there we are again on that little town street<br>
                You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me<br>
                Wind in my hair, I was there<br>
                I remember it all too well<br>

                Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red<br>
                You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed<br>
                And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team<br>
                You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me<br>
                And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"<br>
                Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town<br>
                And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now<br>
                He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was<br>
                'Til we were dead and gone and buried<br>
                Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same<br>
                After three months in the grave<br>
                And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you<br>
                But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame<br>

                And I know it's long gone and<br>
                There was nothing else I could do<br>
                And I forget about you long enough<br>
                To forget why I needed to<br>

                We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light<br>
                Down the stairs, I was there<br>
                I remember it all too well<br>
                And there we are again when nobody had to know<br>
                You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath<br>
                Sacred prayer and we'd swear<br>
                To remember it all too well, yeah<br>

                Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much<br>
                But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up<br>
                Runnin' scared, I was there<br>
                I remember it all too well<br>
                And you call me up again just to break me like a promise<br>
                So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest<br>
                I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here<br>
                'Cause I remember it all, all, all<br>

                They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell<br>
                Every time you double-cross my mind<br>
                You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine<br>
                And that made me want to die<br>
                The idea you had of me, who was she?<br>
                A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you<br>
                Not weepin' in a party bathroom<br>
                Some actress askin' me what happened, you<br>
                That's what happened, you<br>
                You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes<br>
                Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show<br>
                But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come<br>
                And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"<br>

                Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it<br>
                I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it<br>
                After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own<br>
                Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone<br>
                But you keep my old scarf from that very first week<br>
                'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me<br>
                You can't get rid of it<br>
                'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah<br>

                Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known<br>
                It was rare, I was there<br>
                I remember it all too well<br>
                Wind in my hair, you were there<br>
                You remember it all<br>

                You remember it all<br>

                And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes<br>
                "I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"<br>
                From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones<br>
                I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight<br>
                And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?<br>
                Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?<br>
                'Cause in this city's barren cold<br>
                I still remember the first fall of snow<br>
                And how it glistened as it fell<br>
                I remember it all too well<br>

                Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?<br>
                Just between us, do you remember it all too well?<br>
                Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well<br>
                Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)<br>
                Down the stairs, I was there, I was there<br>
                Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there<br>
                It was rare, you remember it all too well<br>
                Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)<br>
                Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)<br>
                Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there<br>
                It was rare, you remember it (All too well)<br>
                Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there<br>
                Down the stairs, I was there, I was there<br>
                Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there<br>
                It was rare, you remember it<br>
                Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there<br>
                Down the stairs, I was there, I was there<br>
                Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there<br>
                It was rare, you remember it<br>
